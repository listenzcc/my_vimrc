# This is my vim config

The aim is to keep VIM minimize and useful.

The plugins are from [ultimate-vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc.git)
To boost vim startup, I elimite some plugins.

## Install
Clone and creat .vimrc

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/amix/vimrc.git  ~/.vim
    sh ~/.vim/mk_vimrc.sh
